{"name":"Universal Analytics","tagline":"PHP Implementation of Google's Measurement Protocol","body":"# Google Universal Analytics - Measurement Protocol\r\n\r\nThis implements Google's [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/). This protocol is a REST api which you can use to send data from your client or server side.\r\n\r\nThis is a server-side implementation, which you might want to use to send analytics to Google that's related to your application - server metrics, exception tracking, etc.\r\n\r\nGoogle developer docs can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/devguide).\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThis is available via Packagist. You can install this by adding a dependency in your `composer.json` file.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"fideloper/universalanalytics\": \"dev-master\"\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run:\r\n\r\n    $ composer install  # or composer update\r\n\r\n**Note:** Composer will now [install the dev dependencies by default](http://seld.be/notes/composer-installing-require-dev-by-default). For this project, those are [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/) and [mockery](https://github.com/padraic/mockery).\r\n\r\n## Basic Usage\r\n\r\nHere is some basic usage:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$ua = new \\UniversalAnalytics\\UA(array(\r\n    'v' => 1,\r\n    'tid' => 'UX-XXXX-XXX',\r\n    'cid' => 555,\r\n));\r\n\r\n$event = new \\UniversalAnalytics\\Track\\Event;\r\n$event->category = 'Video';\r\n$event->action = 'Play';\r\n$event->label = 'Cat Video 42';\r\n$event->value = '0';\r\n\r\n$request = $ua->track($event);\r\n$response = $request->send();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, there's a slightly easier implementation:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$ua = new \\UniversalAnalytics\\UA(array(\r\n    'v' => 1,\r\n    'tid' => 'UX-XXXX-XXX',\r\n    'cid' => 555,\r\n));\r\n\r\n$request = $ua->event(array(\r\n    'category' => 'Video',\r\n    'action' => 'Play',\r\n    'label' => 'Cat Video 42',\r\n    'value' => '0',\r\n))->track();\r\n\r\n$response = $request->send();\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
